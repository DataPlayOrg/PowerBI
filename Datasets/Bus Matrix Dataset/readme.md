## Introduction

This repository contains the dataset and instructions for creating a Business (Bus) Matrix Architecture using Power BI. The task involves identifying business processes, defining dimensions, and creating a detailed matrix that shows the relationship between the business processes and the dimensions of the data.

## Task Overview

### Objective

The objective of this task is to create a Business (Bus) Matrix Architecture from the provided dataset. A Bus Matrix Architecture is a detailed matrix that shows the relationship between business processes and the dimensions of the data.

### Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Identify Business Processes**
   - Analyze the dataset to identify key business processes.
   - Document each business process and its relevance to the data.

2. **Define Dimensions**
   - Determine the dimensions that are relevant to the business processes identified.
   - Define each dimension and document its attributes.

3. **Create the Architecture**
   - Construct a matrix that shows the relationship between the business processes and the dimensions.

## Data Files

The dataset provided for this task can be found in the PowerBI/Datasets/Bus Matrix Dataset folder of this repository. Please download and review the dataset before starting your analysis.
