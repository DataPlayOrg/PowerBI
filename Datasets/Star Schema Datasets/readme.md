## Introduction

This repository contains the dataset and instructions for creating a Star Schema using Power BI. The task is designed to help you practice creating a Star Schema, which is a common database schema used in data warehousing and business intelligence.

## Task Overview

### Objective

The objective of this optional task is to create a Star Schema from the provided dataset. A Star Schema is a type of database schema that consists of a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables.

### Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Identify Fact and Dimension Tables**
   - Analyze the dataset to identify the central fact table.
   - Identify the surrounding dimension tables.

2. **Design the Star Schema**
   - Create a schema diagram that shows the relationship between the fact table and the dimension tables.

3. **Implement the Schema in Power BI**
   - Use Power BI to load tables and relationships that represent the Star Schema.
   - Load the dataset and create the necessary relationships between tables.

4. **Create Star Schema**
   - Build a dashboard in Power BI using the Star Schema.

## Data Files
